1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,939
So Vivian working on our get points methods and get points methods are separate.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,410
There are separate get points methods for every single type like energy, K2, sugar gram, saturated

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,850
fatty acid, sodium mg.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,680
All of them have their own get points method and all of these methods they can estimate a score type,

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,740
which basically is food, beverage, water and cheese.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,400
So these are the methods that we'll be working on.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,020
But in addition to these are two functions that are really common, really important.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,440
Okay.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,549
So those functions, one of them is energy from KCAL.

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,230
And then there's one more function that will need, which will be basically salt from, say, sodium

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,240
from salt, because you're taking the amount of salt, but you want to get the sodium content of the

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,200
amount of salt, right?

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,790
What will be an MSG like?

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:51,420
MG But sodium only constitutes a particular point or percentage of salt.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,080
All right, so let's define those functions.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,020
Let's do the first function that you want to talk about is energy from get get it.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,320
This is the function being called from your main function.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:12,060
So energy from KCAL takes and KCAL, which is Food 64, and it returns energy and kilojoules.

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,320
Okay.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:23,460
So what you're saying is that the energy, the standard metric or the the unit of energy should be kilojoules

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:23,800
always.

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,120
Right.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,130
But we get kilocalories.

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,920
But if we want to convert to controls, how do you do that?

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,410
So we can see that we'll be returning energy called kilojoules.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,630
Okay.

27
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,350
And educating.

28
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:45,900
Now, when we say energy cu it we're basically saying energy is what, 64.

29
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,830
So we're running a type energy get urges for 64.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,210
And how do you get that?

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,320
You get K can multiply it by 4.184.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,190
So this is the formula, this is the legit formula of converting KCAL into joules.

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,500
Okay, kilocalories from kilojoules, this is how you do it and this is what this function it does this

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,360
function it doesn't energy you which is basically like I showed you is flow 64, right?

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,390
It's a different type that we've have defined here and that's what we're doing from this function.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,620
So that's perfect.

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,430
Now, the next function that we want to talk about is.

38
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,650
Sodium.

39
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,810
From soft.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,470
Okay.

41
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,790
So that is salt msg.

42
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:43,750
So like I said, you know, it takes in the amount of salt which is again filtered 60 for salt MSG,

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,240
but it returns sodium mg.

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,520
Sodium mg is something that you've defined.

45
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:48,910
Okay.

46
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,010
Sodium mg.

47
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,860
We have defined as 64.

48
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,610
So it's come here.

49
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,920
So we get the value of salt, but we want to add on the value of sodium that it contains.

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,830
And this will be solved in G divided by 2.5.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,630
All right to the salt empty that you'll get here in this here, which should be small, is much less.

52
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,500
And you'll divide that by 2.5.

53
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,390
So when you divide that between 2.5, you'll get the amount of sodium in that salt.

54
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,700
So I hope that makes sense.
