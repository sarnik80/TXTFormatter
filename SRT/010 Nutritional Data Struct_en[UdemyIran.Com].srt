1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,470
Now that we've defined all these types and also our struct functions core, it's time to define our

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,940
nutritional data struct.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,149
So nutritional data, as you know, is the data that the user will input in terms of all this information.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,720
But to have this represented in Golang, we have to use a struct.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:32,610
So we say type nutritional data, which is structured and you will say energy.

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,000
Sugars.

7
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,890
And saturated fatty acids.

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,080
Sodium

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,980
juice.

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,450
Fiber

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,900
protein

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,250
and whether the product is water.

13
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:08,330
So when you go and check out an industry leader, by the way, feel free to use this as a screenshot.

14
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,530
When you're writing out that code for that struct, you'll see that we are using these values energy

15
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,240
sugars, saturated fatty acids, sodium foods, fiber protein and as water.

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,420
If that entities of water is water, I don't

17
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,910
know and start to define our variables in a struct or values in a stroke.

18
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,230
You also have to define a type for all of these values.

19
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,070
They could be int string or could be another type that you have defined.

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,290
So if you've just defined these types here and that's exactly what we're going to use out here, so

21
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:54,040
for energy, we're going to copy our energy gauge and we're going to produce it here for sugars.

22
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,460
We're going to copy our sugar gram.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,090
Basing it here.

24
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:11,550
Saturated fatty acids will copy and paste it here for sodium will copy and paste sodium mg.

25
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,930
For fruits, we will copy and paste our fruits percent.

26
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,450
For fiber will copy and paste fibre ground.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,700
For a protein, we'll check protein grown.

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,270
And as water.

29
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,370
As a Boolean.

30
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,970
Right.

31
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,720
So we defined our own types and we use all of our types to create nutrition data and additional data,

32
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,360
as you already know, as the information that the user will give us about what he's just eaten.

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,490
He's just logging that in.

34
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,210
So now we have our nutritional score struct.

35
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,830
This is the end result that we want from this entire program where value is the most important thing

36
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,280
and values.

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,880
What we're printing out here and the mean or go find and unusual result and additional data is basically

38
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,920
what the user's going to send.

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:23,040
So this nutritional data that the user is sending basically from, I mean not confined to this function

40
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,750
called good nutrient score function is essentially this nutritional data.

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,640
I hope this all makes sense now.

42
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,260
Everything ties in together.

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,190
Additionally, that's technically justified, has an additional goals.

44
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,640
All of these things and the nutrition data that you're sending in from your main file into a function

45
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,960
called Get Score has all of the same things energy, sugars, sodium, foods, fiber, etc., right?

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,400
So I hope all that now makes sense.

47
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,660
And now we'll proceed and we'll work on our get an additional score function, which is the most important

48
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:04,500
function, but we'll just define it and the inner workings will come back to that after a while after

49
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,120
we've created some more functions.
