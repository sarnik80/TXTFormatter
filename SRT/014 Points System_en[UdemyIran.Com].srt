00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,230
Guys.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,210
So the nutritional calculator that we are making as quite a scientific one, and if you open up any

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:13,800
scientific journal like this, you end up seeing a chart, a chart like this where you get some points

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,830
like zero, one, two, three, four and so on, some points based on how much density of these particular

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,220
items is there inside the food.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,370
So for example, what's the energy density in a sense, kilojoules per 100 gram, right?

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,550
How much energy does that food provide?

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,930
So that gets some points.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,370
Sugars get some point based on is the sugars, you know, less than 4.5, less than nine doesn't 13.5,

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,720
less than 42.1.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,290
That unsaturated fatty acids get some points because of that.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,990
You know, we get some points because of sodium.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,090
How how how much the sodium in the food per hundred grams if you get some points.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,680
So these are these points are all calculated and then these becomes the negative one.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,610
So as you can see that these things, they have a negative negative impact on the nutritional score

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,750
in the sense of energy density.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,730
Sugars, fatty acids and sodium are negative things that are considered negative if you eat these things

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,240
in your food.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,040
So if you have a very high energy density in the sense that if you drink Coca-Cola, right, Coca-Cola

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,730
has a very high energy density because just calories, it has a lot of sugar.

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,470
So you will get a lot of negative points.

22
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,020
If you eat any any fried food, you'll get saturated fatty acids.

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,690
If you eat any salty foods like French fries, it will have both fatty acids and a lot of sodium.

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,100
So those are all negative things.

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,000
You shouldn't be eating that.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,830
So that's how you'll get points.

27
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,420
But the points that you'll get from here will be negative points and you'll get some positive points

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,370
based on the amount of fiber that you have are fruits, vegetables, etc., and the protein that eat.

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,670
Right.

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,750
So if it's greater than that or less than that, depending on that, will get these points.

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,610
But these will be the positive points.

32
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,800
Now that obviously translates into our program.

33
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,640
That means that we will have to have a function that takes in these values or takes in the value of

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,950
the item that we have consumed.

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,550
And then compared with these steps, these are different steps.

36
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:05,720
Right.

37
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,080
That has the scientific community has created for us based on that will create these points.

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,740
We get these points.

39
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,880
So we need to store these different values in terms of areas of some of it, all of these values for

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,160
energy density, we need a place to store these values for sugars.

41
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,950
We need to store all these values 4.59 or these four such and fatty acids.

42
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,660
We need to store these value for sodium as well.

43
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,350
And then whenever somebody eats something, we need a function that converts, you know, compares those

44
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,970
values with these values and gives us these points for all of these different things like energy, sugar,

45
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,990
sodium, etc..

46
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,820
And similarly for the positive things as well, whenever somebody had something, you want the function

47
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,370
to compare with these values, right?

48
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,730
So firstly, you need to obviously store these values somewhere in places like for fiber, this depth

49
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,870
is good in steps, you have to store some it, then you need the function that takes in those values

50
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,500
that the user has consumed and then compare with these steps and then give us these points.

51
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,640
These will be the positive points.

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,490
And then obviously at the end you want to like calculate the positive and negative and then arrive at

53
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,440
the final nutritional score at the end.

54
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,580
So what I'm going to do now in the next video will start actually converting all of that into our code

55
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,340
so that it helps us to actually calculate the nutritional score.

56
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,950
But I hope you've understood where this is coming from.

57
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,120
Check out, you know, leading nutrition journals.

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,280
This is how I, I calculated.
