1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,740
Since it's a nutritional calculator, here are the things that we'll be tracking.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,830
We'll be tracking the energy levels, the sugar levels, sodium levels.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,060
So what are you most basically from salt?

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:22,050
Fiber that can come from fruits, protein levels, saturated fat, fatty acid levels, energy levels

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,420
of beverage and sugar levels of a beverage.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,950
So these are the general things that we'll be tracking in every food group or any food that the user

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,580
wants to log in.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,990
So basically the idea will be that the user will be seeing that this is what I had for for food, and

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,600
he'll probably be sending us a lot of information.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,070
So I'll show you how the information would be sent to us.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,320
But the things that we do tracking in our nutrition calculator will be these major things.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,480
So as you can see, we're tracking quite a few things.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,640
We're tracking the energy levels, which are basically your calories are killer calories and your sugars.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,130
It's just basically grams of sugar that the person has eaten.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,680
Milligrams of sodium and fiber and protein.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,150
And we'll also be checking the saturated fatty acid doubles energy levels.

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,350
So for a beverage that had you levels and sugar levels would be little different.

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,730
So that's why I've kept energy levels of beverage and sugar levels of beverage as a separate entity

19
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,450
that we'll be checking.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,020
So for us to come to know that this is a beverage or a food item will have to do something for that

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,350
as well.

22
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,590
Right.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,190
So let's discuss about that also.
