1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,510
So now that I've shown you that we have to create slices to store all those different values, and you

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,690
have to create that function that will go through the value that we send it from on main or go file.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,630
And then compared with those values and give us this point system based on those charts.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,060
Let's start with creating the slices first.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:26,730
So I'll go here after I've created all my structs and my types, and before these methods begin and

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,080
we start creating some variables.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,940
So the first variable that I'm going to create is energy levels.

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,210
Okay, I hope you can see it as a levels.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,740
And this is a slice of plots.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,730
It'll all be the single answer.

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,520
And similarly, let me create a couple more of these slices and then we'll start putting those values

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,330
that we saw in the top.

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,300
You saw some values for each of these, and the john will start filling those in.

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,280
So you have sugars that levels again is slice

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,060
and then you have saturated fatty acids.

16
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,940
Again.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,050
A slice.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,000
Then you have your sodium levels.

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,170
Sodium.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,000
Levels.

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:31,680
Yeah.

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,470
Florent 64 and both of these.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,380
They're also going to have some values here which we will soon fit in.

24
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,910
And then you have your fiber levels.

25
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,450
Float 64.

26
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:06,160
So this will have a small s and we also have great levels here because we are those all of those are

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,420
steps on two levels basically.

28
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,669
And then you have protein

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,300
levels.

30
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,560
Floyd 64.

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,910
Then you have energy levels beverage.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,710
So these ones, you know that you have energy levels, sugar levels, all of these because we just saw

33
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:34,610
those in the, um, and the just that, you know, we'll have to keep these, these exact values are

34
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,650
what we're going to pick up and put in those slices.

35
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,910
So for the energy slice, we'll put these values sugar slice, we'll put these exact values for the

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,650
sodium unsaturated fatty acids.

37
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,660
We'll put these exact values in the slices.

38
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,060
So that's what we'll do now.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,690
And there, apart from these, there are a couple more.

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,060
So there are two modes.

41
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,350
One is for energy levels.

42
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,020
Beverage.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,180
Which is 64.

44
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,710
And then we have our sugar levels, beverage source sugar levels.

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,830
What happens, as we already know, that beverage and food items are going to be treated separately

46
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,450
because obviously we have a score type that's dependent on inputs, which is food and beverage.

47
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,020
Right.

48
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,090
So that's why for as and beverages also have energy levels and sugar levels.

49
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,340
So we want to treat them separately.

50
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,400
64.

51
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,130
So now it's the time to actually start filling in those values that we just saw in this chart, the

52
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,000
values that we saw.

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,570
It's time to start filling in these exact values, copying and pasting those values.

54
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,880
I have them somewhere.

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,520
So I'm just going to write them.

56
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,670
So feel free to write with me.

57
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,500
This code will be there with you anyways.

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,980
On GitHub.

59
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,050
If you don't want to write with me, you can just copy and paste them.

60
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:04,570
But for people who are not going to be using the GitHub code and are going to put along and I'll just

61
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,080
manually write these values, feel free to skip forward.

62
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,410
If you're getting bored in this section, you'll see four or five.

63
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:11,920
Then you have

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,670
2010167513401056

65
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,620
7285.

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,640
So as you can see, I've copied and seen these exact values and I've put them here in my code.

67
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,240
Okay.

68
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,180
So sugar levels now, sugar levels.

69
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:44,400
Let me look at the values and then start typing them here for five 1636, 31, 2017, 25 you have 18,

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,830
13.5.

71
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,110
You have 9.5.

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,790
Awesome.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,700
Now for saturated fatty acids, acid levels, we will have as you can see, you have the quite straightforward.

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,480
This is 1097 to 1.

75
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,970
That's that's quite straightforward.

76
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,550
So we'll say ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

77
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,610
Sodium levels.

78
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,140
What are you going to do about the sodium levels?

79
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,670
We'll take the values from that again.

80
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,650
900 810.

81
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,350
726.

82
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,280
35.

83
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:31,320
44, 53, 62, 71, 80 and 90.

84
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,900
And then you have your fiber levels.

85
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:49,440
As you can see, we have to write about our fiber and also five levels at 4.7, 3.7, 2.8, 1.9.9.

86
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:59,190
Protein levels 86.4, 4.82.2 and 1.6.

87
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,630
And for energy levels in beverage you have.

88
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,190
Do 7240.

89
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:20,510
210 one 8151 2019 1630 and zero

90
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:41,090
and four sugar levels and your beverage you're going to have 13.5 12 10.59, 7.56, 4.531.50.

91
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,130
So we have created our levels.

92
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,760
Now we need to work on the function that is going to range through all this and then help us to get

93
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,320
to the points that you need.

94
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,160
Okay.

95
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,490
And we are going to call that function.

96
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,190
We are going to call it get points from range.

97
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,100
So we'll arrange over it and then we'll get the points.

98
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,720
And the function would be called get points.

99
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,790
The points in a parking lot out here.

100
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,200
Right.

101
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,510
Get points from by going over these ranges and comparing those values.

102
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,000
So that's what we'll be working on in the next video.
