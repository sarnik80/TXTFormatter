1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,190
So we've been working on our get points functions for energy, CG and sugar ground.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,860
Now let's do the same quickly for SFA.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,530
And sodium.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,660
So for SFE, which are saturated fatty acids, you're going to hit on

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:24,960
the good points from range again for the inside this you're going to be passing this SFE

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,220
and he used busing to try to assert limits just to make sure you can go here and check that you have

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,470
a slice already called the saturated fatty acids.

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,140
And that's what basically it's going to be sent now for sodium mg.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:53,710
You're going to have done again to see him get points from range for 64, you'll pass s and pass sodium

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,160
levels.

11
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,770
Okay, now let's do the same for fiber and protein as well.

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,380
So we'll come to fiber and protein and out here.

13
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,430
And fiber and pudding.

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,780
So we're not doing it for food because for foods it's going to be slightly different from fruits.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,580
The get points from range function isn't going to be very effective for us.

16
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,560
There's a separate way of calculating points for our fruits.

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,690
So we'll do it for fiber and get points for protein first.

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,450
So we'll see.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:29,700
But don't you get plans from range 64 f some fiber levels.

20
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,300
And here you'll see that done.

21
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,070
Good points from range.

22
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,230
164 B, come on.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,130
Protein levels, right.

24
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,950
So far, most of these get points functions.

25
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:49,880
Are done.

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,900
You're done with energy.

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,130
K.J. We don't have to go to ground.

28
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,540
We're done with SFE.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,370
So the MG program, including the one that's left, is food suppressant.

30
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,450
And for that we'd have to do something separate.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,820
Our documentation mentioned something separate for foods.

32
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,680
And this is why this function, which is the get points from range function, is not going to be enough

33
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,310
for us.
