1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,670
In the last video we worked on the get points from change function and I mentioned that this function

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,680
is quite important, quite central because from all of these functions the get points function for energy,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,400
for sugar gram, for saturated fatty acids, 20 milligram.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,830
We're just going to be calling this function to get points from the range because we have these steps,

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,670
right, these ranges.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
And we're going to be basically passing these ranges to this function.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,820
And the function names have been going to help us to calculate the points, which is the most important

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:32,970
thing.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,810
We need those points.

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,080
Right?

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,260
So now let's start with this function, the get points function.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:50,910
So the get points method for energy, the first thing that you want to check because you know, when

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,450
you're calculating for energy, it could be with the beverage or with the food item.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,760
So going to check if it's a beverage or not.

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,180
And if it's a beverage, then what you'll be passing will be energy levels beverage.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,060
This particular space is what you'll pass because this has different these have different points or

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,190
steps, different ranges and steps.

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,890
Whereas for food.

19
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,350
It'll be the regular energy levels slice.

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:32,060
So here we'll take if these berries then return get points from range float 64 E come on energy levels

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,960
average.

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,150
And you'll return.

23
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,630
Get by strong range.

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,140
Yeah.

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,600
So if it's Beveridge, then you'll call this function.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,060
Otherwise you're calling this function.

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,200
Get points from range.

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,670
Um, the regular function with the regular energy levels.

29
00:01:52,730 --> 00:02:00,550
So it'll say float 60 4p0 and it shows.

30
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,080
So I hope you understand that if it's a beverage, I'll just repeat again, if it's a beverage we're

31
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:12,230
calling get points from main function, which we just created in the last video but with the energy

32
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,610
level beverage slice.

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,970
Whereas if it's a food item, right, if it's not beverage, then you use get points from range, but

34
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,510
you'll pass that our regular energy levels, these ones and these energy levels, as you've seen, we've

35
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,890
got it from the documentation, either the official energy levels based on which the points need to

36
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,550
be carbonated and for the culprit in those points, which would be either positive or negative points.

37
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,740
This function is going to to those points for us.

38
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,480
Awesome.

39
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,370
Now, let's do the same for the sugar drum.

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,540
Get points for action.

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,090
Method, slightly higher quality function is actually a method whereby you see something like this,

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,250
right?

43
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,750
It's a matter, it's not a function.

44
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,740
This is a stuck method.

45
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,750
So now for Sugar Gram, it'll be again.

46
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,830
Same step.

47
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:09,450
You check our beverage and you'll return this SD Or this function is accepting SD This photo taken for

48
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:20,970
beverage and then you're turning get points from range load 6040 come on sugar levels beverage.

49
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,120
Right.

50
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,360
Just as you know, with marriage, you have to have marriage.

51
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,830
So you've passed that.

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,470
Here.

53
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,900
It's it's not easy.

54
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,700
So here he was energy cagey.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,110
Right here we have SE, which is sugar ground.

56
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:42,920
So we have to pass.

57
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,610
That's why you can see us wiggling here because it doesn't know what he is.

58
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,570
And that's correct.

59
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,430
Because we should have written out here.

60
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,360
S So written we get two points.

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,210
I know I make these mistakes and I won't be adding them out because I want you to know that, you know,

62
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,640
I want you to observe good lines when they come.

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,200
And I want you to observe that you don't.

64
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,850
You might also make a mistake here.

65
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,120
So it should be instead that you have to pass here instead of glossing over these and not including

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,740
them in the video, I would be doing a disservice to you.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,490
So here you're passing s again and you're saying sugar levels.

68
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,740
Okay.

69
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,150
So we're past basically this place.

70
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,610
If it was buried, we would have passed this place.

71
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,080
It's food.

72
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,900
We pass this place out here.

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,190
Both of them are different steps, and we get points separately based on food.

74
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,540
The points are different depending on these dips which we acquired from the documentation part, the

75
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:48,990
cat food.

76
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,110
Okay, so now similarly we have these other get points methods that we want to work on now.
