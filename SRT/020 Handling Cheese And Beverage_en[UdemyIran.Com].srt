1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,680
So having done quite a few things, we are back to our good traditional score function.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,790
Now as you see that we are checking for nautical to water.

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,790
That means that there will be many things that won't be equal to water.

4
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,090
Right?

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,130
For example, there could be cheese, food or beverage, all three things.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,900
They won't be equal to water.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,430
If it's not equal to water, then you do all these things.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:31,470
Okay.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,880
Otherwise, you don't do anything.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,040
So if they're not equal to water, you'll do this.

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,870
These operations, like finding out the food points, five points, negative and positive are common.

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,650
But these are also getting applied to all key things like height, which are not water, which is cheese,

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,460
food and beverage.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,290
But there are some things that you want to do specifically if the item is cheese.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,540
So what you see is a double equal to cheese and in cheese when it comes to cheese.

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:03,810
Right.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,420
What you'll see is character.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,470
When it comes to you the value.

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,130
So as you know what the nutritional score has positive and negative score driven value.

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,070
Value being an important thing, right?

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,520
So the value that you want to send for cheese, the value the way it's calculated as negative minus

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,690
positive.

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,340
Now all these things that we're doing right, planning out the negative scores, finding out the positive

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,980
scores, the way the videos that we're giving like this.

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,150
Right.

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,280
And finding it saying that for cheese, it's always negative and positive.

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,380
All these things are the recommended things, the things that are recommended in that particular, you

28
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,130
know, science journal.

29
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,100
But these are all changeable.

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,570
I mean, we're not scientists, we are not nutritionists.

31
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:48,780
Right?

32
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,800
We are just learning goals.

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,080
And so please keep your eye on the ball.

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,890
Even if you're right, positive minus negative doesn't matter.

35
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,850
Nobody's going to really catch you for that.

36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,160
So here, according to their suggestions, it's it should be negative minus positive for cheese specifically.

37
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:02,820
Okay.

38
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:12,120
And for anything other than cheese, you know, I think that's obviously not water, not cheese you

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,720
want to have.

40
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,180
You answered a couple of things you want to say negative.

41
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:28,060
If the negative is greater than equal to 11 and the fruit points less than five, you want to say value

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,270
is equal to negative minus positive.

43
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,300
So this is minus, minus positive, minus the fruit, two points.

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,620
So firstly, we're entering I'll just repeat again, if you're entering this look, this scored block

45
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,840
because for all things that are not water and we do some common processing tool here, then we want

46
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,770
to have we want to separate them out to see if it's G, then you want to see this.

47
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,870
If it's anything else except cheese and water, then you will do something like this, which is values

48
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,930
negative, minus positive, minus the food points.

49
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:01,690
Right?

50
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,210
What Jesus obviously sees won't have good food points, right?

51
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,620
This is why you're doing this.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:15,970
And else you have value because it's negative minus positive.

53
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,490
So if negative is a little then equal to learning four points as it is in five, then you can have this.

54
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,420
Otherwise, it still values negative aspects too.

55
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,260
And this is how your final score has got to be it.

56
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,700
So this is how your values have to.

57
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,080
And this is what they are.

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,790
Good condition score function does.

59
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,200
So our good nutritional score function is kind of complete now.

60
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,400
Now, at the at the beginning of the video, we had written this constant.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,080
We had defined this constant which had food, beverage, water and cheese.

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,230
And we didn't score diapers equal to either when we when we did something like this.

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,120
This is the idiomatic way of working.

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:09,820
Recording isometric is the idiomatic you can call it as the preferred way of writing Golang preferred

65
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,560
or recommended or prescribed way.

66
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,270
But the most efficient for you, right?

67
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,160
The most accepted contributor, right.

68
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,740
Golang You don't have to do it, but writing like this basically makes it idiomatic.

69
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,740
Now, a lot of the reason I'm explaining to you this is because a lot of you might be learning, might

70
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,550
have learned Golang properly, and a lot of you might be coming from another programming language thinking

71
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,650
that it's just learning Golang directly by building a project or a tool, a project like this.

72
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,980
Right.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,470
So people who have learned Golang properly, like who have, you know, learned through tutorials and

74
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,630
seen a lot of videos online, they already this that whenever you have to create enemies, you write,

75
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,190
I like this because as I write, you know my degree of writing Golang typing this in Golang.

76
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,640
But people who might be coming from a different programming language, who have not gone through an

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,160
official introduction to Golang and not watched official basic Golang videos, you might be thinking

78
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,430
you might get thrown off by this, might see your desire to do my current center.

79
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,830
So all you have to remember is that you can let go along the way you want to.

80
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,510
But then there's the described idiomatic V of writing Golang, which is like the accepted kind of weird

81
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,920
writing Golang, and that when you have to create an enum like this, constant has multiple things.

82
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,480
This is not just a constant.

83
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,410
This is like an enum, because these are the four values that this concept can have.

84
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,600
So when you do something like this, that's very right, IOTA So I hope that's clear.

85
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,480
You can read more about it, obviously in the office without documentation.

86
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,910
And now comes the get your discourse function.
