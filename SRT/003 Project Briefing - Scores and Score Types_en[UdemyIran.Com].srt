1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,660
So as I mentioned, we need a way to track if the item that our user has consumed as a food item or

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,620
as a beverage.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,450
And there are two more things.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,000
When you look at nutritional calculators, there are two more things that the dietitians ask you.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,100
If it was water, white, rose cheese.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,140
So the way you calculate for cheese is very different from that of beverage and regular food items.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,410
And water is definitely, you know, completely something else.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,060
So it'll have its own values.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,850
So this these classifications of these four things keep in something called a score type.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,950
So just remember that we have something called a score type, which will basically have whether it's

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,530
the food item is food, beverage, water or cheese.

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,540
Because when you want to track on a track for food items and separately for beverage items and similarly,

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,180
water may not have many of these things.

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,880
So we'll have to think of a different way to handle the water.

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,240
And like I said, dietitians have a different way to also grade and handle cheese.

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,379
So we have to keep these two things separate other than food and beverage.

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,630
Now, the way we'll be grading this food, let's say the user has eaten something and we want to calculate

18
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,460
we'll be giving something called adds a nutritional score to that food item that the user has consumed.

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,060
Now, to give the nutritional score, we'll have a track, all of these things for that food item and

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,610
we'll have to give a value based on how much energy, how much sugar and how much sodium, etc., that

21
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,380
the food item has.

22
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,970
So it has two things positive and negative, and then obviously it has a score type.

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,410
So nutrition score will have a score type, which, as you mentioned, food, is it a food, beverage,

24
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,920
water or cheese?

25
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,380
But the final value that will be returning will be basically the value that it has scored will have

26
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,770
a value.

27
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,450
We'll have two more things.

28
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,820
It'll have something called positive or negative.

29
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,620
Now positive comes from having fiber and protein in the food, and negative would come from saturated

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,320
fatty acids, sugar levels and sodium levels.

31
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:05,520
Right.

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,000
So sugar and sodium, having more of these in the food product is not considered good by dieticians

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
and having fiber and protein is considered really good.

34
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,860
So you'll have a positive score, you'll have a negative score for that particular food product based

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,980
on what those food products have, based on this track that we create.

36
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,580
And the final calculation will be stored in this value, which will also depend on the score type.

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,220
So when you're tracking this score data, which is if it's food or water or beverage is going to be

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,420
really considered that as well.

39
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,600
So we considered all these different things to create basically the value of the nutrition score.

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,100
And this is the thing that we are returning.

41
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,570
So we just need to keep these things in mind.

42
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,470
What is the score type?

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,960
Well, what we mean by positive or negative, because once we start coding, everything will get clear

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,260
to you.

45
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,760
But also knowing all of that right now in a visual format, it's so much better.

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,460
So this is why I do a lot of visual planning before I start writing any code, because now even have

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:04,820
a letter.

48
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,090
Somebody is watching what I'm doing or something like I'm training somebody on how to do it.

49
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,180
They would be able to see or even if not training.

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,500
If I'm collaborating with another developer, they would be able to start planning with me.

51
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,990
So that really put plan the code in a much better way, right?

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,250
So this is why I do a lot of visual planning and this is why I want to show you that this is a nutrition

53
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:23,610
score.

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,680
This is what I mean by score type and this is what I mean.

55
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,520
I'm tracking something if you want to take screenshots like now these and when you're coding, you can

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,950
always refer to these screenshots to just ensure that you understand what you're doing at the moment.
