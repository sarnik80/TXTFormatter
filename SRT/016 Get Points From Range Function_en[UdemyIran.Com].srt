1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,590
So now we want to build a function that takes in the value, right?

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,780
The value that the user would input for each of these things and for each of these things, we can call

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,250
that function.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,060
So that function functionally common for energy levels, sugars, doesn't matter what, but all of these

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,220
will be calling that particular function that be calling for everything.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,450
So the function is supposed to go through these steps, be it for energy or sodium or sugars or whatever,

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,550
supposed to go to all the steps.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,540
And then it's going to compare that value and then basically give us the points based on this chart.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,800
These points is what we want.

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,350
So the function is going to look very, very simple.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:47,380
The function basically is going to call and get points from range of g would be small get points from

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,130
mid-range range takes it, like I said, the value.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,390
So for each of the values like sodium, salt, sugars, we call this function, this common function

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,220
again and again, this function is quite central.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,270
It's going to be called again and again.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,870
So remember that.

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,090
Okay.

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,360
And this function, usually it'll it'll help if we keep this as the last function in your entire fight.

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,580
So you'll have here float 64, you'll have steps.

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,990
Steps will be a slice of 64.

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,650
Now way will it be a slice of float 61.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:23,640
Because for each of these things, let's say if we want to find out the score for energy, the points

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,800
for energy, so you'll send out the value of energy that the food has for that he was a user has consumed

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,860
going to also send it these energy levels these this entire slices what are you going to send to that

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,280
function?

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:35,820
All right.

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,750
So that's what you're sending here.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,700
So it's getting a slice, but you're also getting the value.

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,750
And now what it determines is a point, because this point, these points, that's the end result that

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,530
you want from the function.

31
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,000
So that's going to be an integer.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,930
Obviously what we'll do is we do a variable called steps, then steps which will basically be the length

33
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,650
of the steps slice that you get to.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,230
So the how are big that slices, you'll get the length of that right.

35
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,639
And what you want to do is you want to range over the steps that you've received at this function,

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:16,320
got range with that and you want to access the right beta and you want to access the value for each

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,650
step.

38
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,300
So that's going to tell.

39
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,280
Now, if we which is the value that we have received in this function of the particular item, the sodium

40
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,260
should better the user has consumed.

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,480
If that is an error in the sense if that value is greater, then let's say it's between 60 and 1005,

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:35,760
right.

43
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,120
Or between 1500.

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
It's it's greater than any of these values.

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Let's say you get in this and you want to have that particular score.

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,520
So what do you want to do?

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,440
Done is you want to return the steps minus high.

48
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,850
That's how you get the formula.

49
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,620
So you get the number of steps here.

50
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,190
One, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and minus the later on, which you are this

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,940
at the third.

52
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,120
Right.

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,290
So that's how you to get the point, right?

54
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,420
That's how you can get the point.

55
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,720
And this that's getting the done from here at the point.

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,170
Just make sure there's capital in and steps and then everything will make sense.

57
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,730
But if you've gone through the entire range, if you've gone through the entire far loop you've got,

58
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,540
you get nothing.

59
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,710
As in the value is not greater than any of these values.

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,550
It's it's smaller than even 335.

61
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,250
Here are 4.5 here on one here and 90 here.

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,880
Then the point is going to be zero, right?

63
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,520
It was less than this.

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,050
It's obviously it's going to be zero.

65
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,950
So you can return.

66
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,520
Zero.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,250
Okay.

68
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,290
So I hope the function makes sense now.

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,060
This is going to be quite a central function.

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,380
We're going to call it again and again is going to be common for finding out the value or the points

71
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,340
for energy sugars, sodium, fiber, saturated fat acids, energy for levels for beverage and sort of

72
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,570
beverage for all of those.

73
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,720
We'll be getting this function again.

74
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:51,920
Again.

75
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,170
Okay.

76
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,170
So this is just a small way of basically getting this point from these values.

77
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,460
So I hope that makes sense.

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,690
In the next video, we'll start working on the actual get score function, which we have, but we start

79
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,780
working on these functions now get points functions for all of these.

80
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,060
That's all going to get points methods for all of these different things.

81
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,160
So that's what we'll start working on.
