1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,580
Now, one important thing to keep in mind is for all of these methods to get points, methods you want

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,840
to be passing the scored type in all of these in some see VI.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:20,250
But for now, just write SD And all of these functions that you're sending SD basically out here, the

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:20,880
score type.

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,210
Okay, it over.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,810
Now like I said, you know these are not functions get points is not a function get point is a method

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,750
and you'll have a separate method for fruits and a separate get point method for five separate get good

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,800
points for the for energy.

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,080
And all of these methods will help us calculate those points for all of these different things, because

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,500
foods need to be treated differently if I want it to be treated differently.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,280
And you got to know that energy sugars, protein have to be treated differently.

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:58,290
The reason they have to be treated differently is because they have different.

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:00,810
Units.

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,680
Okay.

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,450
So that's why they have to be all due to different.

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:15,020
So now we'll have let's start writing at least the outlines of all of our mythologies that we'll be

17
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,350
needing.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,180
So we'll need let's start with energy.

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,360
So we need a metric for energy, a get points method for energy.

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,860
So a funk get points.

21
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,060
All right.

22
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,680
This is how you define a funk function.

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,840
But like I said, it's not a function.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,350
It's a method of energy.

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,340
So energy.

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,150
K.G., JJ is the flute that you've defined the type of define.

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,900
So you'll say energy caging.

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,280
And here you'll have to say E, because that's the particular variable that you'll get here.

29
00:01:53,330 --> 00:02:02,480
And as you know that this get points function accepts a s t the score diepsloot and c s-t is the squat

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,620
type that you would accept.

31
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:14,020
The get points function is supposed to return and end because you want to you want to get it from here

32
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,820
so that all of that ends will come.

33
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,750
We'll add them up and we'll create one negative value in one positive that is immediately.

34
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,620
So as soon as you define dysfunction, right?

35
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,590
Good point.

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,650
As soon as you talked about dysfunction, the squall line out here is going to go long noted agonizes

37
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,330
that okay, dysfunction.

38
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,980
Is there somewhere this man is already dead.

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:34,770
And.

40
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,290
But there's this big line out here still.

41
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,730
It's because.

42
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,280
There's no written statement and that's all.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,250
We'll talk about what we're going to have done from this method, in a way.

44
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,030
But now you have this for energy.

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,710
You want to have this for structures as well.

46
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,210
So let's write the one for each.

47
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,740
So we'll say -- and get.

48
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,470
Points.

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,490
You know, it takes a school day and you know it it doesn't.

50
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,640
The only difference will come here will be down here.

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,160
It will be sugar ground and we will use SX for sugar ground.

52
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,390
Now, as soon as we did that, you can see the squiggly line for sugars get points functional so that's

53
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,750
gonna be.

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,960
And the next function that you want to create, the next method that you want to create as far as saturated

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,740
fatty acids.

56
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,100
So I can go here and you'll see funk again.

57
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,150
Same thing at points.

58
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,040
And it's.

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,390
Estes Park score date and.

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,970
Around here you'll see.

61
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,400
Saturated fatty acids will use a user.

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,450
William Blake SFA.

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,480
For that.

64
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,350
So now when you did this, your schooling for SFE also has a really good points function.

65
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,860
Now you'll work for sodium.

66
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,209
So you'll say.

67
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:19,470
From.

68
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:29,600
And get points as to school type

69
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,110
and.

70
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,810
Forget points, you'll say S which is a type sodium mg because that's what you would define here.

71
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,190
You've defined sporting mg, right?

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,120
And this function was also done.

73
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,330
Squiggles and God scores.

74
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:57,020
Okay, now we're left with the get points for fiber, fruit and protein.

75
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,490
These three functions need to be done.

76
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,390
So let's look for the fruits once and see some.

77
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,220
We get points.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,310
SD as score type and integer.

79
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,390
Funk here is Broots person.

80
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,430
Right now going to do the same for fiber and protein.

81
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,420
These are the only two things left.

82
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,890
So when you go here to look at the screen, Langley protein and fiber, those two things are left.

83
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,690
So let's say for bunk.

84
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,070
Um.

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,330
I have will be if I were Graham.

86
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:55,380
So, sir, if I were Graham get points as to the school time and teacher.

87
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:58,990
Right.

88
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,830
And you'll have it for protein GRAMSRAMS.

89
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,140
The protein gram.

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,610
Get points.

91
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,770
Jason has just caught up.

92
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,730
And Scott, I like the guns and.

93
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,840
So all of these functions are get points function, but they're all methods, they're not functions

94
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,030
and they're all for different things.

95
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,090
One is for protein, one is for fiber lines, for for presidents.

96
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,080
So we're calling all these methods here and we're passing score types here, but they're all different.

97
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,720
They're all going to be, you know, handling different type of data and adding different types of values.

98
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,260
So this is basically what I want to show you that now we have you know, we've been creating the outlines

99
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:58,140
of all the functions and we're basically understanding how things are going to fall together properly.

100
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,100
And I'm sure everything is also kind of making sense to you that, you know, this is how we had written

101
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:08,310
it and scored what it needs, detailed initial score and you know, what are these different types and

102
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,740
why we're using all these methods, all of that.

103
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,860
I'm sure things have started to make sense and if not, we'll write more and more code and everything

104
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,210
will start coming together.

105
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,230
And I think that makes sense to you.
