1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,870
So whenever a user is logging what he has eaten so that our calculator is able to calculate the nutritional

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:14,970
score for that food item, food or drink or beverage, he's basically going to give us the energy sugars,

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,760
saturated fatty acids, sodium fluids, fiber protein.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,050
And he's going to tell us if it's water or not as water or not.

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,870
So the user will basically give us this information, at least in a basic raw format, and we'll have

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,060
a function called get nutritional score function.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,980
So the spelling here is wrong.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,810
So C, get nutritional score function.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,600
And at the end, the end result for us is to get a nutritional score.

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,850
So we'd be accepting all this information from the user if it's water or not, if it's a beverage,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,660
all of those things.

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,900
And we'll have a function called good nutrients called function and we'll be getting the nutrition score.

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,930
This is the most important thing and this is what we want and are not able to do.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,730
And you already know that nutritional score will have a positive negative based on, you know, if it

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,540
has a lot of sugar or sodium or it has a lot of fiber and protein, which these are two are positive,

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,950
these two are negative.

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,800
So based on that, the final calculation and also have a score type which as you know, it's food,

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,670
beverage, water, cheese will have a final value, which is the nutritional score.

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,270
So all of that is happening in this function.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,140
And this function obviously will call multiple functions.

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,440
And the end result of this function is the nutritional score.

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,630
This is something that we need.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:26,930
Right?

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,970
And this is based on this nutritional data that the user would give us.

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,310
So by now, till now, you've understood that we're going to have a function.

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,850
So whenever we like to go right, we're going to have a function called nutrition score function.

27
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,360
And you know, that will be the mean and goal of our calculator is to return something called as the

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,230
nutritional score and the user, when he inputs something, will have all of these values.

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,520
We can either accept it from a CLIA write or we can have our may not go file to accept all these values

30
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,790
or to accept or to be basically keep these as variables, basically.

31
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,979
So we'll use I mean, go file and we'll keep all of these things as a variable rather than accepting

32
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,520
it from a CLIA, because our next two projects are about building CLIA applications.

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,480
So in this first project, we'll have a different approach.

34
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,830
Okay.

35
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,090
So we'll be accepting this from our from the user and we'll be basically tracking all of these things.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,950
So we already know that we'll be tracking all these things, right?

37
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:34,310
And we also know that these are the units that will follow to track and calculate all of those values.

38
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,150
And at the end, as you know, you will get the nutritional score.

39
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,020
So this is what I basically wanted to show you the entire picture of.
