1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,670
So in our nutrition scorecard file we're going to write.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,820
We define.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,890
Score type, which is.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,780
Just ain't.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,370
All right.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:22,280
So we already know that Oscar types are going to be of food, beverage or cheese, these types.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,490
Right.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,220
So we'll get to that in a second.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,300
But for now, what we'll do is we'll define some constants.

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,000
So one constant is food.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,510
These questions are based on these food types.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,170
Score types.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,530
Okay.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,490
Beverages.

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,000
What a cheese.

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,330
So it's a food beverage.

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,040
Water and cheese.

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,040
All right.

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,030
So for Ford witnesses for Type

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,480
II auto.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:10,830
I screamed out to you in a minute, but along with that, what do you want to create as a struct called

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,540
nutritional score?

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,920
The nutritional score struct, as you already know, will have a value positive, negative in score

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,570
type and score divers.

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,950
What we have to find just not right.

26
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,710
So we have defined a score type and the constants here will tie in to the score type, which we'll talk

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,340
about in a minute.

28
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,320
And the nutritional score basically is a struct.

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,750
And the struct, as you already know, has a value as a positive and negative.

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,720
And score died.

31
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:01,180
Now the value positive and negative are basically integers.

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,760
And the score type is of type.

33
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,430
Score type.

34
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,900
This one out here.

35
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,900
So we've created our own diapers or defined your diapers and school type as of type.

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,250
That particular type.

37
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:24,920
All right.

38
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,390
So now we'll move forward.

39
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,180
So what do we have to do now is we have to actually check out these units.

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,640
So you know that to process the nutritional data that you get from the user and to the nutritional score,

41
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,480
you need the right units to do that.

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,600
You need the right variables to define the right returns.

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,810
And what we'll do now is we'll define these variables.

44
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,780
So we'll say type, energy type, sugar ground.

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400
All of these types would be the final.

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:17,210
So we'll say output type, energy kilojoules, float 64 and type sugars from float 64.

47
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,030
Diet saturated fatty acids flawed 64.

48
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,720
And sodium mg.

49
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:39,230
Feel free to use this screen as a screenshot and we're basically just defining these variables for these

50
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,600
types.

51
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,070
That's it.

52
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:47,570
Source type sodium mg lot 64 and type.

53
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,810
Throats for Senate Floor two 664.

54
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,440
And day driver Graham Ground 64.

55
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,420
Type protein girl for 64.

56
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:17,970
So we're done defining our own types here, but we need to be able to process this information.
