1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,510
Now slowly our entire project is coming along quite well because we have defined quite a few things,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:06,960
right.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,240
So things are starting to make sense.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,740
The most important thing they really know is to get an additional square function.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,050
We have not defined the function yet.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,530
That's why we're getting this big line on here.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,780
So in an indigenous golden glow fire.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,980
What we'll do is we'll write at least the about this function.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,930
Let's start doing that.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,870
So get an additional square, which is the name of the function.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,380
We know that, except a few things have done.

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,240
Something will have a function definition.

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,130
Now what is it done?

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,600
We know from our planning that the good nutrition square function has to have done a nutritional score.

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,960
So let's say nutritional score is one of the drugs.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,050
It isn't scorers as a start that you have defined, right.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,830
So that means somewhere at the end of this function, you'd have to say it had done a nutritional score,

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,810
but it does an additional score, right,

19
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,830
which is a struct.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:20,940
And that started only, you know, that it has these four different values or one is the value, the

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,550
other is positive.

22
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,470
Then you have negative.

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,590
And then you have.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,260
Poor type.

25
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,450
So for valid you'll have value for positive.

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,550
You will have positive.

27
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,340
For negative and have negative.

28
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:55,130
Now these four values, eight score type value, positive, negative, or at least these three values,

29
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,710
the first three values is something that you will get on in this function.

30
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,220
We don't we don't have these values yet.

31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:08,840
But school day was something that we may have access to because and the good nutritional score function,

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,530
you're sending the nutritional data, but at the end you can see you're sending food.

33
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,370
Right.

34
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,780
And what is food?

35
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,180
Food is school type.

36
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,060
Okay.

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,940
So now this function get additional square function because we're calling this function on kindergarten.

38
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,770
It's called function in the mean function.

39
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,970
We already know it takes nutrition data and takes score dive.

40
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,450
So at least we want to add that here.

41
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:43,410
So we'll say it takes nutritional data, it takes school day, but these are the types.

42
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,040
But you also need a variable to handle whatever this function gets.

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:57,510
So SD will store the squad that you send here, which is basically in this case, it's food, right?

44
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,600
But it's of type, school type similarly and is the nutritional score that you get.

45
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,690
So the nutritional data that you get is N and it's what type of nutrition data.

46
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,950
So that's quite consistent because nutrition data is a struct that we've defined has energy, sugar,

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,830
sugar, saturated fat levels, sodium foods, fiber.

48
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,700
And so we have sent those exact values from our main function.

49
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,330
So everything for now is making a lot of sense.

50
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,120
Not just value positive or negative, since we don't have these things as of now.

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,750
What we'll see is that in the beginning of this program, all of this as zero.

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,120
All right.

53
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,060
Now you know that the score type you already know, right?

54
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,230
The score type is off these four types.

55
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,880
Food, beverage, water, cheese.

56
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,050
I if you remember at the beginning when we were planning water, I told you that water and cheese is

57
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,250
treated very differently by nutritionists or dietitians.

58
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,730
So we want to check if this the scored average a cent, which we're sending food, by the way, right

59
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:17,850
now.

60
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,089
But if it's not, what are we going to check that if it's not water?

61
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,260
We're going to do a couple of things because water does not have fruit or fiber, right?

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:36,490
So when you're creating or finding out the nutritional score, you want to find out the fruit points

63
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,400
and find out the fiber points.

64
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,480
And then you to find out the negative.

65
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:53,850
And even if I'm not positive, the negative and positive that you're talking about here is part of the

66
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,530
nutritional score, because some things have negative values.

67
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,540
For example, sodium and sugar, as you only know that.

68
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:08,220
You want to talk about that, that, you know, positive are basically fiber protein things, those

69
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,400
type of things that positive and negative are sodium sugar.

70
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,160
Those type of things.

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,600
That negative.

72
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,000
So your negative will have energy,

73
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,160
plus your sugars, plus it'll have your.

74
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,230
Saturated fatty acids.

75
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,760
And your sodium, right.

76
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,880
And your positive will be fiber.

77
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,680
And protein.

78
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,690
But you'll also get some food points to the same food points.

79
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:13,970
And for fiber, your right fiber points right to these four things that we get from somewhere now and

80
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,230
all of these values, right?

81
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,990
Energy sugars, saturated fatty, acid, sodium, etc., we get that in the nutritional data, but you

82
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,310
know that the nutrition data needs to be in a particular format.

83
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:26,930
Right.

84
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,130
And from that particular format, you want some value out of it.

85
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,700
And that value is you're going to get it from

86
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,160
something called as a get points metric.

87
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,180
So get points of the method, right?

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,150
And nutrition data is and you already know that ten is nutrition data.

89
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:02,400
And we're accessing the get points method for fruits, right.

90
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,130
So this may not make a lot of sense to you right now because we have not defined this method of get

91
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,660
points yet, but this method called get points, we'll have to define it for every single thing we never

92
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:12,960
defined.

93
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,470
For fruits, we'd have to define it for fiber, for example, out here.

94
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,180
Also, I'm going to need fiber.

95
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,250
I'll state okay points.

96
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,720
Right for energy.

97
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,160
For energy, I'd have to say.

98
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,920
And not energy.

99
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,670
Don't get points for sugars, I'll say.

100
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,440
And not sugars.

101
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,980
Got to get points.

102
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,420
For saturated fatty acids.

103
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:52,160
LC And diet saturated fatty acids do not get points.

104
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,360
And for sodium as well.

105
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,470
I'll say the same thing.

106
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,240
Endorse sodium, don't get points.

107
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,680
And now for the positives.

108
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,960
Also, since you got four points and five points from here from these get points functionality here

109
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,370
for protein, you'll say protein, don't.

110
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,160
And get twice.

111
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,720
It's quite possible.

112
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,340
This doesn't make much sense to you.

113
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:39,270
But all you need to understand for now is that a negative is formed by calculating the addition of energy

114
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:46,070
points, sugars, saturated fatty acids, sodium rates.

115
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,720
All of these things are negative or bad for the body.

116
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,090
And all these things, fruit, fiber and protein are positive for the body.

117
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,930
They're good for the body.

118
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,570
So if it's not water, that means it's food and beverage.

119
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,090
You want to do this, food, beverages, all of that.

120
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,830
If it's water, we'll do something else.

121
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,320
We'll do something different inside this.

122
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:04,830
Right.

123
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,470
Also, we'll have a separate point for cheese.

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,420
We'll do something for that as well.

125
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,660
So this is basically the general, you know, part where we want to start.

126
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,020
Now this water is not getting recognized because it should be capital W.

127
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,270
And now see, that's going to ask all of you.

128
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,110
So this is your core function.

129
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,650
We have a few more things to do here and but mostly now let's talk we'll talk about the get points function.
