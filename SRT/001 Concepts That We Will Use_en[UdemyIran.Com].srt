1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,760
So this is our first project and this course, and we're building a nutritional calculator.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,400
We'll be using basic golang concepts, but we'll be using them in depth, and you'll be using them in

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,079
the context of a project so that whatever you've learnt around these concepts, you'll be able to apply

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,610
them and learn them much better.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:27,240
So the concepts that we'll be using are slices, f, ls statements, logical operators, floats and

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,830
a lot of calculations around them.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,150
How to build structs and how to use struct methods, loops and ranges and functions.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,160
As you can see, these are all basic concepts of Golang.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,970
We have not gone into calling APIs or working with weird groups or go routines and all of that.

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,780
You just you're going to use the basic concepts in this nutritional value.

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,400
It's just a fancy calculator.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,250
But since you'll use all of these concepts in the context of the project, you'll understand everything

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,850
much better.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,770
So this is the right way to start.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,670
Once you've done the basics of alignment to understand the basics, this is the right thing to do.

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,650
And using all of these concepts and building something that you can practice again and again and you

17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,580
can learn depth through it.

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,100
So let's get started.
