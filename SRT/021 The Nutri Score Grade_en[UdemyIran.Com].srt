1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,500
Now the purpose of nutritional score was to calculate this value.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,350
Finally, Nutri Score is slightly different.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,400
You just score with diseases that you don't.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,530
Even when you got the points back, you got two points for every single food and then you calculated

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,080
the final value for that food item.

6
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,910
You want to get like a grade, you know, ABCD, that kind of a score is what you want.

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,900
So this is going one step ahead.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,220
I mean, you don't have to do this.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,630
You can end it at having a value, having an individual score.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,040
And this is why I showed you at the end.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,060
You know how you can that one, we can do something called Nutri Score as well.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,790
So you've just got as just going ahead a one step ahead, taking whatever you've done to another level.

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,080
It's not required.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,950
Not compulsory.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,910
Completely optional.

16
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,210
Right.

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,940
And if you have calculated the value, that's good enough.

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,770
But here we just going one step ahead.

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,870
We're seeing that, you know, just having the value of what into the score is not enough.

20
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:08,020
Having a grade like ABC D could be, you know, more acceptable in some places and some, you know,

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,970
like, let's say if you are if you've consumed some food product, you might not want just to score

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:21,190
a point for that, you might just want ABC has it that is in bad faith based on, you know, ABC, those

23
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,150
kind of ranking.

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,930
So you can do that and it's not very difficult.

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:37,310
What we will do here actually is create a new variable called score to measure.

26
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,760
So we'll take the score from the food like, you know, the total of the points you got.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,390
You had got logic to calculate points and then you calculate the value by having positive and negative

28
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,160
points for all of the different things.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:00,280
And now you'll take that score and you can imagine two letters greater meaning like this.

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,900
A, B, C and D.

31
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,890
Only thing to remember is to cover them and to end these double quotes as these are strings.

32
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,890
So this slice.

33
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:38,260
Call squad later as well will be using to take the squad that you'll get and to convert it into a letter.

34
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,030
Okay.

35
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:50,610
So here's what you'll do now is you'll see if all smiles or if there's start squad type is fooled,

36
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,110
then you'll return.

37
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,300
Score two letter.

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,650
Okay.

39
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,900
So for food, you want to do something for water or you want to do something else?

40
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,360
It's our first dart court type.

41
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,370
You are something else.

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,850
And otherwise, you ought to do something else.

43
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,020
Okay.

44
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,110
So he'd also have done school letters.

45
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,140
And here it is, valued at one.

46
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,410
I scored the letter.

47
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,400
So we're checking for food or water and for everything else except food and water, which is basically

48
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,120
cheese and beverage.

49
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,260
Okay.

50
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,110
So for food, what do you want to do?

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,270
You want to first say you get points from dinner.

52
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,710
Okay.

53
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,200
And you want to say 464 and start spending.

54
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:05,450
So earlier when we were calling this function called get points from range from any of these functions,

55
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,460
when you're calling this function, get points on range, you are passing the amount of fiber, the

56
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:16,160
amount of protein, the amount of sugar basically into that function at points on range.

57
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,610
But right now, the final value that you have, which is an assault value, it's a nutritional score

58
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,510
dot value.

59
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,550
The value is what you're passing here.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,110
So you took the amount of sodium and fiber and protein, all of that, and you got points using our

61
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,060
get points from the instruction you get toward those points and then using those points, you calculate

62
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,860
the final value.

63
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,590
This is what we did.

64
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,260
And they get into some support function called defined value.

65
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,920
And now using that value we are again calling the same function, get points from the intervention and

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,730
getting back a particular score and then using that score to find the letter equivalent score of that.

67
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,910
So here you will see flawed.

68
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:13,070
And again, the values that we are passing here are basically steps like these steps and these are the

69
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,920
official steps given to us in that documentation.

70
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,490
So adding comma ten and two, comma x one.

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,130
So we're passing these steps.

72
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,300
As you can see, steps is what this function.

73
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,970
Dixon Get on French.

74
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,760
Dixon step ten.

75
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,810
Dixon the value.

76
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,400
So if passport.

77
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,830
And based on that, whatever score it gets like one, two, three or four or five, whatever you will

78
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,200
get squad two later.

79
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,020
So what's happening here?

80
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,360
Essentially, let me show you in a comment.

81
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,600
So squad leader has this kind of slice.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:59,010
It has a, B, C, D rank.

83
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,710
It has something like this.

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,720
It has a slice like this.

85
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:15,170
And when you see it's called two letters and you call these functions here, you will get a score.

86
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,910
You will get a score like you don't see it all.

87
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,880
One, two, three, four, whatever.

88
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,990
And here to

89
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,780
help us go like this back from this function.

90
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:34,940
So if you get a score of one, so you know that score of one score, the letter of one, which is this

91
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,920
index is B.

92
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,270
You know that I took the score would be the final.

93
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,350
Nutri score that you get if you get score two letter and these brackets whether it comes back from this

94
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:57,210
function get points from the instruction is let's say to you will have the value of C that that will

95
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,360
be the final distance nutri score.

96
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,700
So having cleared that.

97
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:12,150
And I would say that for Walter Scott, letters of zero, which is basically a great sweater, will

98
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,050
always be engraved and it turns gold letter off.

99
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:26,190
You get going from range floored 64 and again has dot value.

100
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:36,150
You will have a flawed 64 off nine comma 5.1 common master.

101
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,280
All right.

102
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,930
So this completes most of our program.

103
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,030
Right.

104
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,390
We have our get points functions.

105
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,250
We have our good nutrition score function.

106
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,560
We have our get nutri score function and get points from range and.

107
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,100
Still in your go fight, you'll see all the squiggly lines.

108
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,260
And the reason for that is you have to pass some values here.

109
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:19,320
So let's say you pass zero here, then here you pass to here, 500 milligrams of sodium.

110
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,400
You pass 60 here for here.

111
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:34,140
You know, whenever a user consumes some food item or any item, he will get this nutritional information

112
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,809
from the food item that he's consuming, maybe from the labels.

113
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,669
You know, and what he's going to do is he's going to come here and he's going to basically input this

114
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:41,970
value.

115
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,200
Now, like I said, you know, we have not been to select a will that interacts with the user to take

116
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,780
these values.

117
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,920
That's because the other two projects that we have are both CLIA rules.

118
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,220
So I didn't want you to I didn't want to have the same pattern that you just selected.

119
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,500
So that's why we're just accepting values now from this func main function.

120
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,180
Now, you can accept these values from a friend and you can build a small front in an email or even

121
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,990
in React and accept these values on your computer.

122
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,010
Or you could put a very simple zero rule buildings here that will see in our second and third projects.

123
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,960
So, you know, zero balance.

124
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,990
So you could have accepted these values from your Sierra two as well.

125
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,440
But here, just because this is the first project it's supposed to the simplest project will be accepting

126
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,150
values from our directly from our main function.

127
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:24,810
Right.

128
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,000
So anything you want to change these values, we can come here and just edit them the way you want to.

129
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:29,790
Okay.

130
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,020
So for now, I'm just digging up these these particular values.

131
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,250
And let's go over everything once again very quickly.
