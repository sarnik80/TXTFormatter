1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,680
So now that we already know what we're going to be tracking, like energy sugars, sodium, fiber,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,160
protein, etc., we need to have the units defined.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,090
So for energy, we'll be using kilojoules per 100 grams for sugar, we'll be using grams per 100 grams

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,470
of saturated fat and fatty acids will be using grams per 100 grams.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,300
Sodium will be using mg, 400 grams fibres will be using grams, 400 grams and proteins will be using

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,540
grass.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,810
But under drums, these and bowl will be the units that we are tracking.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,020
Make sure you take a screenshot of this right now so that all you can come back to this video so that

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,030
you know, you know where we're coming from.

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,890
So in a nutritional calculator, well, the things that we have to track because on the food item that

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,990
the user has said we'd be tracking based on these units.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,170
So the units are important because that's what the calculator is going to calculate.

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,280
So I hope that's here.
